## Overview

This documentation provides an overview of the advanced technical analysis (TA) strategy implemented in the `Algotrading_Advanced TA Backtesting.py` script. The strategy uses a combination of technical indicators to generate buy/sell signals and execute trades with risk management features. Recent updates have introduced new logic for signal generation, strategy execution, and performance evaluation.

## Strategy Description

The strategy is designed to adapt to different market conditions by using a variety of technical indicators:

- **Trending Market**: Utilizes Supertrend and RSI indicators, with additional conditions based on moving averages (50-period and 200-period) to generate buy/sell signals.
  - **Buy Signal**: Triggered when the market is trending, Supertrend is positive, RSI is above 55, and the 50-period moving average is above the 200-period moving average.
  - **Sell Signal**: Triggered when the market is trending, Supertrend is negative, RSI is below 45, and the 50-period moving average is below the 200-period moving average.

- **Ranging Market**: Uses Bollinger Bands and volatility breakout conditions.
  - **Buy Signal**: Triggered when the close price is below the lower Bollinger Band and a volatility breakout is detected.
  - **Sell Signal**: Triggered when the close price is above the upper Bollinger Band and a volatility breakout is detected.

- **Choppy Market**: No trades are executed unless a volatility breakout is confirmed.

## Strategy Execution

The strategy includes a stop-loss mechanism and an optional trailing stop feature:

- **Stop-Loss and Take-Profit**: Calculated using the Average True Range (ATR) with a multiplier. Positions are closed if the price hits the stop-loss or take-profit levels.
- **Trailing Stop**: An optional feature that adjusts the stop-loss level as the price moves in favor of the position, providing additional risk management.

## Performance Metrics

The strategy's performance is evaluated using several key metrics:

- **Cumulative Return**: The total return of the strategy over the backtesting period.
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Measures the risk-adjusted return of the strategy.
- **Sortino Ratio**: Similar to the Sharpe Ratio but only considers downside volatility, providing a more accurate risk-adjusted return measure.
- **Max Drawdown**: The maximum observed loss from a peak to a trough.
- **Win Rate**: The percentage of trades that were profitable.
- **Number of Trades**: The total number of buy/sell signals executed.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Load Dataset**: Ensure your dataset is prepared with the necessary indicators and saved as `backtest_data_with_indicators.csv`.

2. **Generate Signals**: Use the `generate_signals_advanced` function to apply the strategy's logic and generate buy/sell signals.

3. **Execute Strategy**: Run the `execute_strategy_with_stop_loss` function with the desired parameters, including the optional `trailing_stop` feature.

4. **Calculate Performance**: Use the `calculate_performance_metrics` function to evaluate the strategy's performance.

5. **Review Results**: The script will output the performance metrics, providing insights into the strategy's effectiveness.

## Example

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Load your dataset
    data = pd.read_csv("backtest_data_with_indicators.csv")

    # Generate signals and execute strategy
    data_with_signals = generate_signals_advanced(data)
    data_with_strategy = execute_strategy_with_stop_loss(data_with_signals, atr_multiplier=2.5, trailing_stop=True)

    # Calculate performance metrics
    performance_metrics = calculate_performance_metrics(data_with_strategy)
    print("Performance Metrics:", performance_metrics)
```

This example demonstrates how to load data, generate signals, execute the strategy with a trailing stop, and calculate performance metrics. Adjust the parameters as needed to suit your specific backtesting requirements.
