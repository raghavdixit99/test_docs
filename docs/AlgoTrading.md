# Advanced Technical Analysis Backtesting Strategy Documentation

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the advanced technical analysis (TA) backtesting strategy implemented in the `Algotrading_Advanced TA Backtesting.py` script. The strategy utilizes a combination of technical indicators to generate buy and sell signals, execute trades with stop-loss and take-profit levels, and evaluate performance using various metrics.

## Signal Generation

The strategy generates signals based on market conditions identified as Trending, Ranging, or Choppy. The following indicators are used:

- **Trending Market**: Utilizes Supertrend and RSI indicators, along with moving averages (50-day and 200-day) to determine buy and sell signals.
  - **Buy Signal**: Generated when Supertrend is positive, RSI is above 55, and the 50-day moving average is above the 200-day moving average.
  - **Sell Signal**: Generated when Supertrend is negative, RSI is below 45, and the 50-day moving average is below the 200-day moving average.

- **Ranging Market**: Utilizes Bollinger Bands and Volatility Breakouts.
  - **Buy Signal**: Generated when the closing price is below the lower Bollinger Band and a volatility breakout is confirmed.
  - **Sell Signal**: Generated when the closing price is above the upper Bollinger Band and a volatility breakout is confirmed.

- **Choppy Market**: No trades are executed unless a volatility breakout is confirmed, in which case a buy signal is generated.

## Strategy Execution with Stop-Loss

The strategy executes trades with the following parameters:

- **Slippage**: 0.0002
- **Transaction Cost**: 0.001
- **ATR Multiplier**: 2.5
- **Trailing Stop**: A new feature that allows for dynamic adjustment of the stop-loss level once the price exceeds 50% of the take-profit level.

The stop-loss and take-profit levels are calculated based on the Average True Range (ATR). The trailing stop feature adjusts the stop-loss level to lock in profits as the price moves favorably.

## Performance Metrics

The strategy's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Cumulative Return**: The total return of the strategy over the backtesting period.
- **Sharpe Ratio**: A measure of risk-adjusted return, calculated as the mean return divided by the standard deviation of returns, annualized.
- **Sortino Ratio**: Similar to the Sharpe Ratio but only considers downside deviation, providing a more accurate measure of risk-adjusted return when returns are not normally distributed.
- **Max Drawdown**: The maximum observed loss from a peak to a trough in the cumulative return curve.
- **Win Rate**: The proportion of trades that resulted in a positive return.
- **Number of Trades**: The total number of buy and sell signals executed during the backtesting period.

## Execution Flow

1. **Load Dataset**: The script begins by loading the dataset containing historical price data and technical indicators.
2. **Generate Signals**: Signals are generated using the `generate_signals_advanced` function.
3. **Execute Strategy**: Trades are executed using the `execute_strategy_with_stop_loss` function, with the trailing stop feature enabled.
4. **Calculate Performance Metrics**: The strategy's performance is evaluated using the `calculate_performance_metrics` function, and the results are printed.

## Conclusion

This advanced TA backtesting strategy provides a robust framework for evaluating trading strategies using technical indicators. The inclusion of the trailing stop feature and additional performance metrics such as the Sortino Ratio and Win Rate enhances the strategy's ability to manage risk and assess performance accurately.
